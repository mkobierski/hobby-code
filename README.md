In my free time, I code out of interest.
This repository contains solutions to various mathematical problems from Project Euler,
some in C, some in C++, others in Python.  Also included is a class
BigNumber, which I created to facilitate working with huge numbers
in C++ - it handles cases where numbers are much larger than the limit of
int or long.  Some mathematical operations have been implemented as well,
and while most are well behaved, the odd bug occasionally appears.
